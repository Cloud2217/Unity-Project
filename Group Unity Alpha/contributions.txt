==UNITY PROJECT CONTRIBUTIONS==

Eric: 50%	Luke: 50%

N.B:
Adam heather was originally supposed to be a part of this project, however
he had to drop out at the last minute due to circumstances out of his or our
control. As such, the work load had to be redistributed and many features that
we planned to implement werent able to be completed in time, as we were 
stretched much thinner. Much time was also lost, as we were waiting on Adam to
implement several key features before we could proceed to work on the tasks we
had originally delagated amongst ourseleves.
